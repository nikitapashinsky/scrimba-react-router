# Scrimba React Router course

In this project I follow along with the [Learn React Router 6](https://scrimba.com/learn/reactrouter6) course on Scrimba by the amazing [Bob Ziroll](https://twitter.com/bobziroll).

I **highly** recommend Scrimba â€” I learned JavaScript and the basics of React there and absolutely loved the teachers and the highly-interactive "learn by doing" method.

- The paid [Frontend Developer](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend) career path is also worth every penny. I especially loved the JavaScript modules with [Tom Chant](https://twitter.com/Tpchant).
